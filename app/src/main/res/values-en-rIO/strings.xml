    <string name="TextNewYear">New Year is the main calendar holiday that occurs at the moment of transition from the last day of the year to the first day of the next year. It is celebrated by many peoples in accordance with the adopted calendar. The beginning of the year from January 1 was established by the Roman ruler Julius Caesar in 46 BC. In ancient Rome, this day was dedicated to Janus - the god of choice, doors and all beginnings. The month of January got its name in honor of the god Janus, who was depicted with two faces: one looking forward and the other looking back.</string>
